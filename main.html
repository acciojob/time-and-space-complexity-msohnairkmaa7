<!-- Heading -->
<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<!-- First paragraph -->
<p>
  Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the size of the input. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more efficient.
</p>

<!-- Second paragraph -->
<p>
  Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of the size of the input. It is often represented using Big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial in determining how much memory an algorithm will consume during its execution.
